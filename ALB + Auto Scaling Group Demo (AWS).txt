ALB + Auto Scaling Group Demo (AWS)

This project demonstrates a high-availability, auto-scaling web architecture on AWS using an Application Load Balancer (ALB), EC2 Auto Scaling Group (ASG), CloudWatch, and AWS Systems Manager (SSM).

The goal was to build something realistic, observable, and scalable — and to fully understand why each component exists and how they work together.

Architecture Overview

Services used:

Amazon EC2

Application Load Balancer (ALB)

Auto Scaling Group (ASG)

Launch Templates

CloudWatch Metrics

AWS Systems Manager (SSM)

IAM Roles

What this setup does:

Routes traffic through an ALB

Automatically scales EC2 instances based on CPU usage

Uses SSM instead of SSH for secure instance access

Verifies scaling behavior using real CPU stress tests

Load Balancer & Target Group

The Application Load Balancer distributes traffic evenly across EC2 instances registered in a target group.

ALB details:

Target group health check (all instances healthy):

Auto Scaling Group Configuration

The Auto Scaling Group is configured with:

Minimum capacity: 2

Desired capacity: 2

Maximum capacity: 4

ASG configuration details:

Instances currently managed by the ASG:

Launch Template & User Data

All EC2 instances are launched from a Launch Template that includes user data to automatically install and start a web server on boot.

Launch template user data:

This ensures every new instance is production-ready immediately after launch.

Load Balancer Traffic Distribution

Refreshing the ALB DNS in the browser shows traffic being served by different EC2 instances, proving the ALB is working correctly.

Scaling Policy (CPU-Based)

The Auto Scaling Group uses a Target Tracking Scaling Policy:

Metric: Average CPU Utilization

Target value: 50%

Scale-in and scale-out both enabled

Scaling policy configuration:

CloudWatch Metrics & CPU Spike

CPU usage is monitored using CloudWatch metrics. A deliberate CPU stress test was used to trigger scaling.

CloudWatch CPU spike during stress test:

Systems Manager (SSM) Access

Instances are managed securely using AWS Systems Manager Session Manager, avoiding SSH and key management issues.

Instance registered with SSM:

Stress Test via SSM

A CPU stress test was run directly inside the instance using SSM:

sudo dnf install -y stress-ng
stress-ng --cpu 2 --timeout 600


SSM stress test execution:

Auto Scaling Event

As CPU crossed the 50% threshold, the ASG automatically launched an additional EC2 instance.

Scaling activity event:

Final System State

After scaling:

3 EC2 instances running

All instances healthy behind the ALB

CPU returned to stable levels after scale-out

Final system state:

Key Takeaways

Auto Scaling responds to real load, not just configuration

ALB ensures zero-downtime traffic distribution

SSM is a cleaner, more secure alternative to SSH

CloudWatch metrics are essential for visibility and debugging

Possible Improvements

Add HTTPS with ACM

Store logs in CloudWatch Logs

Add alarms and notifications (SNS)

Introduce infrastructure as code (Terraform / CloudFormation)
